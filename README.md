#  Suicide Risk Detector

A web-based AI application that analyzes user-submitted text to detect signs of suicidal intent using a machine learning model. The app predicts whether the text is **suicidal** or **not suicidal**, along with a risk level assessment (e.g., NONE, HIGH). Designed for awareness, not diagnosis.

---

##  Features

-  Real-time suicide risk detection from text input.
-  Backend powered by a trained deep learning model (.h5).
-  Clean and intuitive React frontend.
-  Instant feedback on risk level: `NONE`, `MODERATE`, `HIGH`.
